Information for users upgrading from 2.6 or 2.7-preXX:
======================================================
- GNUTLS is now used by default when it is available instead of SSL. GNUTLS 
  needs a cafile next to the key and cert files. 
- The "socket" module has been removed, it is now partially part of the core,
  and part of it's functionality has been moved to the "listener" module
- <listen> and client_pass are now below the "liblistener" <plugin> node 
  rather then under a network. For example, to listen on port 6669 for
  connections for network MyNetwork and password MyPass:

  <listener port="6669" network="MyNetwork" password="MyPass"/>
