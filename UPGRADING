Information for users upgrading from 2.6 or 2.7-preXX:
======================================================

Any existing configuration files can be upgraded by running the upgrade 
utility avaiable in the directory 'scripts' in the source tarball.

- GNUTLS is now used by default when it is available instead of SSL. GNUTLS 
  needs a cafile next to the key and cert files. 
- The "socket" module has been removed, it is now partially part of the core,
  and part of it's functionality has been moved to the "listener" module
- <listen> and client_pass are now below the "liblistener" <plugin> node 
  rather then under a network. For example, to listen on port 6669 for
  connections for network MyNetwork and password MyPass:

  <listener port="6669" network="MyNetwork" password="MyPass"/>
- <nickserv> is now below the "nickserv" <plugin> node as 
  <nick> rather then under a network. For example:

  <nick nick="mynick" password="mypass"/>

  The network attribute for this element is optional.
- the "strip", "report_time", "linestack_file", "ctcp" and "repl_none" 
  modules have been merged into the main program and should no longer be 
  included in any configuration files
- the <autosend> element is now handled by the new "autosend" module. Move 
  any elements from <network> to the configuration of this module, 
  with an option attribute for the network name.
