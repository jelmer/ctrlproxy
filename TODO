- test report_time
- test linestack_file
- test repl_command
- finish configuration utility (worked on by Kyoshiro)
- automated testsuite
- use namespaces and XML schemas instead of DTD
- use information from capabilities sent by server
- dcc module
- CONNECT command could try to connect immediately to a network if it is currently waiting for reconnect delay to end for example....
- add gnutls support
- new log system
- generate data for configuration editor from XSL files
- more user-friendly admin command
- system wide ctrlproxy?
 - connect to central daemon that does a fork and starts ctrlproxy in that?
- Modules shouldn't be loaded twice
- non-blocking connect
- make filter order adjustable

Ideas: (ideas for stuff you might want to work on, and is currently not 
		planned to be implemented)
- Net::IRC-like interface
- more admin commands: DELNETWORK, NEXTSERVER, DELLISTEN, DELSERVER
- automatically unload crashing modules?
- internationalization (i18n)
- linestack_mysql
- be able to specify format of NICKSERV commands
