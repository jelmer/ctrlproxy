2.7 showstoppers:
- update documentation (see FIXME's)
- test and fix SSL support
- handle some currently unhandled responses (especially wrt JOIN's)
- answer WHO queries from own data if possible
- support saving current state back to configuration
- support passwords in listener for selecting between networks
- finish python module hooks:
	typedef gboolean (*filter_function) (struct line *);
	typedef gboolean (*new_client_hook) (struct client *);
	typedef void (*lose_client_hook) (struct client *);
	typedef char ** (*motd_hook) (struct network *n);
	typedef void (*server_connected_hook) (struct network *);
	typedef void (*server_disconnected_hook) (struct network *);

next release (2.7.1 ?):
- <allow/> rules in socks and listener based on ip addresses/ranges
- some sort of cascading filters, remove client, network and options from 
  line struct
- more advanced repl backends, rules-based perhaps?
