2.7 showstoppers:
- update documentation (see FIXME's)
- bugs in BUGS file
- test and fix SSL support
- warn about erroneus nicks
- finish python module hooks

typedef gboolean (*filter_function) (struct line *);
typedef gboolean (*new_client_hook) (struct client *);
typedef void (*lose_client_hook) (struct client *);
typedef char ** (*motd_hook) (struct network *n);
typedef void (*server_connected_hook) (struct network *);
typedef void (*server_disconnected_hook) (struct network *);

next release (2.7.1 ?):
 - <allow/> rules in socks and listener based on ip addresses/ranges
 - some sort of cascading filters, remove client, network and options from 
   line struct
 - more advanced repl backends, rules-based perhaps?
