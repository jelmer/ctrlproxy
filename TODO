2.7 showstoppers:
- update documentation (see FIXME's)
- test and fix SSL support
- answer WHO queries from own data if possible
- handle some currently unhandled responses (especially wrt JOIN's)
- new linestack:
 - persistent storage for linestack
 - always log everything, let repl backends query
 - saved per nick/channel per network
 - adding data always happens one line at a time
  - Store: NICK, JOIN, QUIT, PART, PRIVMSG, NOTICE, KICK, MODE, TOPIC
 - data can't be updated
 - querying: 
  - need ways to figure out state before log started (i.e. nickname, 
	names of users in channel)
  - start querying where? number of lines?
- finish python module hooks:
	typedef gboolean (*filter_function) (struct line *);
	typedef gboolean (*new_client_hook) (struct client *);
	typedef void (*lose_client_hook) (struct client *);
	typedef char ** (*motd_hook) (struct network *n);
	typedef void (*server_connected_hook) (struct network *);
	typedef void (*server_disconnected_hook) (struct network *);

next release (2.7.1 ?):
 - <allow/> rules in socks and listener based on ip addresses/ranges
 - some sort of cascading filters, remove client, network and options from 
   line struct
 - more advanced repl backends, rules-based perhaps?
