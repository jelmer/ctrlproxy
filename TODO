 - Special handler for join stuff
- test and fix SSL support
- update documentation

- fix SWIG build
- finish python module hooks:
	typedef gboolean (*filter_function) (struct line *);
	typedef gboolean (*new_client_hook) (struct client *);
	typedef void (*lose_client_hook) (struct client *);
	typedef char ** (*motd_hook) (struct network *n);

- <allow/> rules in socks and listener based on ip addresses/ranges
- support passwords in listener for selecting between networks
- some sort of cascading filters, remove client, network and options from 
  line struct
- more advanced repl backends, rules-based perhaps?
