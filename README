Why ctrlproxy?
--------------
CtrlProxy is a project I started because I got bored with running irssi in 
screen on my server. My server isn't very fast and that meant 
when it was on high load ircing was getting pretty hard. I could 
of course run irssi on my workstation, but my workstation isn't on 
24/7 and some people depend on the channel logs I generate.

Features
--------
 * Connect to one server with many clients under one nick transparently
 * Connect to multiple servers using only one process
 * CTCP support when no client is attached
 * irssi-style logging support
 * Transparent detaching and attaching of clients
 * Password support

Requirements
------------
 * libpopt
 * GNU libc

Building
--------
 
ircproxy can be installed using:

$ make
$ make install

You might want to change the PREFIX in Makefile.settings

Documentation
-------------
Most documentation is in the manpages: ctrlproxy(1) and ctrlproxyrc(5)
The example ctrlproxyrc file might be of some use..
