If you are upgrading from an older version of ctrlproxy, please read the 
file UPGRADING.

Why CtrlProxy?
--------------
CtrlProxy is a project I started because I got bored with running irssi in 
screen on my server. My server isn't very fast and that meant 
when it was on high load ircing was getting pretty hard. I could 
of course run irssi on my workstation, but my workstation isn't on 
24/7 and some people depend on the channel logs I generate.

Running ctrlproxy requires much less bandwidth then running a 
remote irssi inside screen and it works much better over high-latency 
connections.

The structure of CtrlProxy is modular and it is easily extendible.
