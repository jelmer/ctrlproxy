For a quick start, see the bottom of this file.

If you are upgrading from an older version of ctrlproxy, please read the 
file UPGRADING.

Why ctrlproxy?
--------------
CtrlProxy is a project I started because I got bored with running irssi in 
screen on my server. My server isn't very fast and that meant 
when it was on high load ircing was getting pretty hard. I could 
of course run irssi on my workstation, but my workstation isn't on 
24/7 and some people depend on the channel logs I generate.

Running ctrlproxy requires much less bandwidth then running a 
remote irssi inside screen.

The structure of ctrlproxy is very modular and it is easily extendible.

Features
--------
 * Connect to one server with many clients under one nick transparently
 * Connect to multiple servers using only one process
 * CTCP support when no client is attached
 * irssi-style logging support
 * Transparent detaching and attaching of clients
 * Password support
 * Replication support (from memory or file)
 * Auto-Away support
 * Keeping track of events occuring 
 * Direct, inetd-style interfacing with local IRC servers (such as bitlbee)
 * Responses to queries are only sent to the originator of the query
 * SSL support
 * Custom logging in any format you specify
 * Flood protection

Requirements
------------
 * libpopt
 * GNU glib
 * libxml2
 
 And for the stats module:
 * libpcre (optional)

Building
--------

ctrlproxy can be installed using:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

If you have a Subversion checkout, run :

$ autoreconf

before you run ./configure, make and make install

Documentation
-------------
Most documentation is in the manual and the 
manpages: ctrlproxy(1) and ctrlproxyrc(5).
The example ctrlproxyrc file might be of some use..

After you've installed, configured and started ctrlproxy you can connect to 
it on port 6668 and up.

To build the documentation, run ./configure --enable-docs. Please note that 
a pregenerated version of the documentation is available in the tarball. So, 
in most cases, you shouldn't need to rebuild.

Quick start
-----------
1. Install ctrlproxy (either from debian, or from source, see above)

2. Run ctrlproxy --daemon

3. Surf to localhost:8888 with your webbrowser and configure ctrlproxy.

4. Connect to ctrlproxy from your IRC client. By default, you can connect 
to port 6670.

5. Simply disconnect by typing /QUIT
