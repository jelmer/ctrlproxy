<para>This chapter contains some brief information on how to configure 
	various IRC clients for use with CtrlProxy.</para>

<para>All IRC clients should be able to work with ctrlproxy 
(ctrlproxy acts just like any other IRC server and follows the RFC's). Please 
let us know on the CtrlProxy IRC channel if you find a client that is not working.</para>

		Configure the <parameter>port</parameter> and <parameter>password</parameter> settings in <filename>~/.ctrlproxy/config</filename> and run the following commands in irssi:

			/set proxy_password <replaceable>ctrlproxy-password</replaceable>
			/set proxy_port <replaceable>ctrlproxy-port</replaceable>
