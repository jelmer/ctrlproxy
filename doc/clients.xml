<title>Connecting to CtrlProxy</title>

<para>This chapter contains some brief information on how to configure 
	various IRC clients for use with CtrlProxy.</para>

<para>All IRC clients should be able to work with ctrlproxy 
(ctrlproxy acts just like any other IRC server and follows the RFC's). Please 
let us know on the CtrlProxy IRC channel if you find a client that is not working.</para>

<sect1 id="irssi">
	<title>irssi</title>

	<para>
		Configure the <parameter>port</parameter> and <parameter>password</parameter> settings in <filename>~/.ctrlproxy/config</filename> and run the following commands in irssi:

		<screen>
			/set proxy_address <replaceable>ctrlproxy-host</replaceable>
			/set proxy_password <replaceable>ctrlproxy-password</replaceable>
			/set proxy_port <replaceable>ctrlproxy-port</replaceable>
			/set use_proxy ON
		</screen>

		You should now be able to connect to any networks as you normally would 
		with irssi.
	</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="xchat">
	<title>xchat</title>

	<para>
		Configure socks in xchat to point at the host and port ctrlproxy is listening on.
		If you specified a password in the ctrlproxy configuration, specify it here as well. 
		CtrlProxy will ignore the username that is sent by xchat.
	</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="bitchx">
	<title>BitchX</title>

	<para>
		Configure socks in BitchX:

		<screen>
			/SET socks_host ctrlproxy-host
		</screen>

		and, if you're running ctrlproxy on a port different than 1080:

		<screen>
			/SET socks_port ctrlproxy-port
		</screen>
	</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="other-socks-clients">
	<title>Other clients with SOCKS support</title>

	<para>Clients with SOCKS support can simply configure ctrlproxy as 
		if it was an ordinary SOCKS proxy. The username sent by the 
		client is ignored by CtrlProxy, the password has to match the 
		password configured in ctrlproxy's configuration.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="other-clients">
	<title>Other clients</title>

	<para>Other clients can connect to ctrlproxy as if they were connecting 
		to a standard IRC server. </para>

	<para>The client should log in with the password that was configured in 
		the configuration file, followed by a colon and the name of the 
		network to connect to.
	</para>

	<para>For example, the password to use to login to the network Freenode 
		with the ctrlproxy password set to <constant>geheim</constant> would be:
		<constant>geheim:Freenode</constant>.
	</para>
