<sect1><title>Connecting from XChat</title>
   <para>Question: I have set up ctrlproxy, but nothing happens when I
      connect to it via the XChat client.
   </para>

   <para>Answer: You can't manually connect to ctrlproxy.  The password
      needs to be sent before the NICK and USER gets implemented.  If you
      open a new server tab and connect to ctrlproxy with "/server", NICK
      and USER will get sent before you can manually send "/pass".
   </para>
   <para>To connect to ctrlproxy via XChat, you will need to create a
      server entry where the "Server Password" field lists the password
      given in your ctrlproxyrc file.  Then use the server list to connect
      to the ctrlproxy.  It should then connect and connect to the
      channel(s) you listed for that server.
