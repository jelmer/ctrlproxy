	<title>Remote administration</title>

	<para>CtrlProxy supports remote administration thru IRC. 
	Commands can be executed by either using the /CTRLPROXY command in 
	your IRC client or sending them to the nick 
	<constant>ctrlproxy</constant> on a network. </para>

	<para>The syntax for the commands is very simple: 
	the command should be followed by one or arguments, seperated 
	by spaces. Quoting is not supported. Those familiar with 
	NickServ or ChanServ will already be used to this syntax.</para>
