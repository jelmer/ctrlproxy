	<para>CtrlProxy supports remote administration through IRC. 
	Commands can be executed by either using the /CTRLPROXY command in 
	your IRC client, sending them to the nick 
	<constant>ctrlproxy</constant> on a network or by 
	connecting to the <emphasis>admin</emphasis> network, which 
	is built into CtrlProxy. </para>

	<para>It is also possible to use this interface from the command-line 
		on the machine where CtrlProxy is running by using the 
		<emphasis>ctrlproxy-admin</emphasis> command.
	</para>

	<para>The syntax for the commands is very simple: 
	the command should be followed by one or arguments, separated 
	by spaces. Quoting is not supported. Those familiar with 
	NickServ or ChanServ will already be used to this syntax.</para>
