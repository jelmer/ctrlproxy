Testsuite
--
This directory contains a bunch of testfiles for ctrlproxy. 

Each test: 
 1. writes out a ctrlproxyrc
 2. starts ctrlproxy
 3. does a certain number of connects/disconnects and communicates data

Test server(s)+channel(s) can be specified that ctrlproxy should connect to. 
Some tests will use their own (very simple) IRC server for testing ctrlproxy 
behaviour in certain cases.

Tests should only print the name of a test they're running followed by a 
colon, a space and either "OK" or "FAILED".

Plain text tests
================
These tests are very simple: you specify a configuration, the data to 
send to ctrlproxy and the configuration of the simple server and the ctrlproxy 
output is compared with the output you have specified.
