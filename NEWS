  INTERNALS

	* Reduce number of files generated by configure.

	* Moved source control system to Bazaar (http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/)

	* Use separate include files rather than one large one.

	  to avoid (engineering) overhead.

	* There now is a testsuite that tests some of the internal functions.

	* Add 'debug' module for easier debugging.
